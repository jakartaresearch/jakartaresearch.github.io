title: Anomaly Detection

## Anomaly Types
- Point or Global Anomalies → specific data points
A point anomaly is where a single datapoint stands out from the expected pattern, range, or norm. In other words, the datapoint is unexpected.

Example: sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor — scikit-learn 1.3.0 documentation


- Collective Anomalies → groups of data (unexpected pattern)
where a whole subset of the data deviates from the whole data pattern.

- Contextual Anomalies, where the point deviated based on a selected context

## Anomaly Detection libraries

## ADBench Key Takeaways
None of the unsupervised methods is statistically better than the others, emphasizing the importance of algorithm selection;
Semi-supervised methods outperform supervised methods when limited label information is available.

Personal suggestion on selecting an OD algorithm. If you do not know which algorithm to try, go with:
- ECOD: Example of using ECOD for outlier detection
- Isolation Forest: Example of using Isolation Forest for outlier detection
