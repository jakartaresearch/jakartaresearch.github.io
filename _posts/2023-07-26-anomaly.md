title: Data Jam EP 2 - Anomaly Detection
---

## Anomaly Types
- **Point or Global Anomalies** → specific data points<br>
A point anomaly is where a single datapoint stands out from the expected pattern, range, or norm. In other words, the datapoint is unexpected.

  Example: sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor — scikit-learn 1.3.0 documentation


- **Collective Anomalies** → groups of data (unexpected pattern)<br>
Where a whole subset of the data deviates from the whole data pattern.

- **Contextual Anomalies**, where the point deviated based on a selected context

## Anomaly Detection libraries
- **Tabular** data → GitHub - [PyOD: Python Outlier Detection](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod)
- **Time series** data → GitHub - [TODS: Automated Time-series Outlier Detection System](https://github.com/datamllab/tods)
- **Graph** data → GitHub - [PyGOD: Python Library for Graph Outlier Detection (Anomaly Detection)](https://github.com/pygod-team/pygod) 
- **Image** data → GitHub - [Anomalib: Anomaly detection library comprising SOTA algorithms](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib)

## ADBench Key Takeaways
- None of the unsupervised methods is statistically better than the others, emphasizing the importance of algorithm selection;
- Semi-supervised methods outperform supervised methods when limited label information is available.

Personal suggestion on selecting an OD algorithm. If you do not know which algorithm to try, go with:
- **ECOD**: Example of using ECOD for outlier detection
- **Isolation Forest**: Example of using Isolation Forest for outlier detection [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html)
