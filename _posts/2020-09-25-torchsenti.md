---

TorchSenti is a natural language library that focuses on sentiment analysis tasks which aims to provide sentiment analysis dataset and pre-trained models. The library build on top of PyTorch, we want to support research community to expand the knowledge and contributors to solve current problems. Those features and resources helps NLP researchers to benchmark and evaluate their proposed method. However, this library may be a starting point for everyone that want to learn sentiment analysis in depth. Find the details on the [repository](https://github.com/jakartaresearch/pytorch-sentiment]).
